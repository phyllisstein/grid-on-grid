      Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken
      fingers… with spicy club sauce. Stop licking my hand, you horse’s ass! I
      don’t criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a
      diet is the best defense. I mean, it’s one banana, Michael. What could it
      cost, ten dollars? If I make this comeback, I’ll buy you a hundred George
      Michaels that you can teach to drive! Those are balls.

      the film business for a while but I just can’t seem to get one in the can.
      I’m a complete failure. I can’t even fake the death of a stripper. I made
      a huge tiny mistake. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw. They
      don’t allow you to have bees in here. No, I was ashamed to be <em>seen</em> with
      you. I like being with you.

      Yeah, like I’m going to spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit? Come on!
      Yeah, I invited her. You said you wanted to spend time some with her. You
      said I was being an Ann hog. Michael, I’m your older brother. I’ll never
      be proud of you. Let me out that Queen.
